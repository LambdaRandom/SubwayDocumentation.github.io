<h2>Regular Use</h2>
Keep on the right side of the track<br>
<hr>
When at an intersection, the default path is to stay straight. If you cannot go straight (say you are coming <i>onto</i> a straight path from a spur), then the defualt path is to go right.<br> 
To change your destination from the default to the secondary, you hit the noteblock interface.<br>

<ul>
    <li>Example: Heading on a straight path. Hit the noteblock to go onto the spur.<br>
    <li>Example: On a spur to a straight path, Hit the noteblock to head left on the main track.<br>
</ul>

<h2>Map Reading and Information</h2>
Each track is colorcoded to represent what it is. For example, the "<span class="red">Main</span>" track's color is <span class="red">red</span>.<br>
Each station along a track is labeled with a <span class="black">black dot</span> and its name.<br>
Where different tracks meet, there will be a station that gives the option to stay or switch tracks.<br>
