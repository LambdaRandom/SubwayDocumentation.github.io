<br>
<br>At a stop or station, at least 5 powered rails must be used to accelerate the minecart in order to get it up to sufficient speed
<br>
<br>At every station, the cardinal direction of each pathway is shown by its corresponding <span class="change_red">color</span> <a href="color_code.html">(see Color Coding Standards)</a>
