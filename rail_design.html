<p>The minimum size for a tunnel is 3x3. There is two rails, each powered with a sufficient amountof powered
<br>rails to keep it up to maximum minecart speed (Every 38 blocks if you are already at maximum speed).
<br>
<br>At a stop or station, at least 2 powered rails must be used to accelerate the minecart in order to get it up to sufficient speed
<br>
<br><img src="images/edited/color_coded_intersection_example.png" alt"color coded intersection" class = "smaller"></img>
<br>At every station or intersection, each pathway is shown by its corresponding <span class="change_red">color</span> as shown above <a href="color_code.html">(see Color Coding Standards)</a>
<br>
<br>    <img src="images/edited/standard_track.png" alt="standard subway track" class="smaller">
<br> Each minecart will keep <i>right</i> when going forward as shown on the image above. This is <b>standard for ALL rails</b>, 
<br>unless the track is mono (1 - lane) in which case the track can go both ways.
<br>
<br>    <img src="images/edited/2x2x1 intersection_1.png" class = "smaller">
<br>The default path at all instersections is to go straight, but if you are intersecting <i>with</i> a straight path,
<br>then the default path is left, as shown in the image above.
<br>In <span class="blue">blue is the default path</span>, in <span class="yellow">yellow is the path if you hit the noteblocks</span> (oncoming from a mono rail)

Each tunnel should be dug 5x5
<br> Have each track lined with the color of its pathway <a href="color_code.html">(see Color Coding Standards)</a>
